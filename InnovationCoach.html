          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The assignment for this project was to create a blog with a theme of
            the students’ own choice. It instructs us to use specific pieces of
            technology that we’ve learned for this past year, as well as add
            some requirement to what should be included in the result. As a
            content management system (CMS), we’ve been instructed to use
            WordPress (WP) and to create our blog articles here. Yet the webpage
            that readers encounter should be custom made and hosted separately.
            The technique of “hiding” the WP interface and instead hosts another
            that fetch data with an API is called Headless CMS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blog site was designed, developed, and tested, using tools and
            techniques learned throughout the year. Along the way, the page has
            been tested by multiple users and was adjusted based on their
            feedback to ensure a user-friendly experience. In this project I had
            also prioritized making the existing functionality accessible over
            adding optional functionality. Even so, I got to add most of the
            optional functionality like search and filter but lacks comment
            field on the posts. As this was also something that was requested in
            one of the latest user tests, it was natural to address this as an
            improvement on the site.

          <h2>“Close menu”-button</h2>
          <p>
            A user that used VoiceOver on his mobile phone told me that it was
            annoying that he had to navigate back to the menu button in order to
            close the menu after he had just read through all the menu options
            on his way down. Based on his feedback, I now added a hidden button
            at the end, using much the same technique as I did with the skip
            link. Also, I added that the original menu button received the focus
            when the menu was closed so that it is easy to open it again, and
            intuitive to move the focus further down the page.

          <h2>H1 on “All posts” page when showing search results</h2>
          <p>
            During the next to last day of the exam, I had a user test with a
            blind person. This was really exiting, inspiring and valuable. One
            of the things she pointed out was that the h1 on the page where the
            search results show said “all posts”, which was somewhat confusing.
            This is because it is the “all posts” HTML page that is used to show
            results. I had forgotten it as the h1 tag on that page is only
            visible to screen readers, and I didn’t interact with it so often
            myself. I now made the h1 change to “Search results” when the user
            searched.

          <h2>Comments field</h2>
          <p>
            Nearing the end of the exam project, I got a feedback from a user
            that said he thought it was nice when Blog posts about work subjects
            contained the possibility for comments. He often though it was a god
            starting point for a professional discussion. It was also listed in
            the optional tasks, yet I had not prioritized that one to focus more
            on accessibility and other improvements. In general, I could see how
            it might lower the threshold of interaction when one could comment a
            specific post, rather than having to fill in and send a contact
            form.
          </p>
          <p>
            By looking at the comment endpoint of the WordPress API, I saw that
            I could retrieve and send the data that I felt would be relevant:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img
              width="100%"
              height="auto"
              src="../images/api.png"
              alt="The API '/wp/v2/comment' endpoint spec"
            />
            <figcaption>
              <a
                href="https://morlanddesign.one/innovation-coach-admin/wp-json/"
                rel="noopener"
                target="_blank"
              >
                Go to full API specification
              </a>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>However, when I stared to code, I met multiple challenges:</p>
          <p>
            The first one is that my initial API-testing showed that WP required
            an authenticated user to comment, even though I had checked a box in
            WP-admin that allowed anonymous comments. Then I remember that I had
            a similar problem with the WooCommerce plugin API endpoints for the
            Rainydays project. In that project I ended up creating a theme that
            created a new endpoint that did the same, yet without requiring
            authentication. However, when I did a final search more in the venue
            of custom theme, I stumbled upon this
            <a
              href="https://www.tetchi.ca/how-to-post-comments-using-the-wordpress-rest-api"
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
            >
              tutorial that said there was a one-liner one could add to allow
              comments without authentication
            </a>
            . I thus created a child theme and added the “add_filter” line to my
            functions.php file and could now add comments with the API.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I had coded the form and sent the comment to WP, I realized
            that I would rather see my new comment than get a pop-up feedback
            that said the post was sent. I therefore decided to scroll to the
            comment section, and retrieve all comments anew, so that I could see
            my new comment on top. In addition, I added a loader, so that the
            user understands that the page is retrieving new comments in case it
            takes some time.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>What tag to use?</h2>
          <p>
            When I fetched comments, I was wondering what the correct HTML tag
            would be to use. Initially I was tempted to use plain div tags,
            until I remembered that those should be used as a last resort. I
            found multiple mentions of the article tag, and this made me unsure
            of when to use div, section and article tags. After reading
            <a
              href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#article-or-section"
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
            >
              the HTML spec on articles and sections
            </a>
            , I realized I should use the article tag more often, like in the
            “all posts” page.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Loader as a template</h2>
          <p>
            As I added a loader to the “fetch comments” and “fetch more posts”
            functions, I realized I had forgotten to template the loader,
            breaching the DRY principle. By adding it as a JS template together
            with the function to hide it, it makes the code more maintainable.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Horizontal scrollbar on windows</h2>
          <p>
            In my feedback on the exam, it was mentioned that there was a
            horizontal scrollbar. I was unable to reproduce this bug, yet since
            the corona restrictions had softened, I got hold of a Windows
            computer on which I could reproduce the problem
          </p>
          <p>
            It turned out that there is an issue on windows that is listed in
            <a
              href="https://caniuse.com/viewport-units"
              rel="noopener"
              target="_blank"
            >
              "Can I Use"'s list over known issues for viewport-units
            </a>

            , that I found a reference to through a stackoverflow post. Turned
            out browsers on Windows has been a bit back and forth yet landed on
            including the vertical scrollbar when one use “100vw” in most cases.
            Since I only have mac devices, I was completely unaware of this
            horizontal bar, and it is also omitted in Hotjar recordings. I guess
            other students and users thought I knew, since there was never any
            feedback on it either.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since it is a WCAG breach to have scrolling in two directions, and
            it looks bad, I managed to fix it. Also, I found a mac setting to
            always add scrollbars, even though they are still not very visible,
            I am now able to detect this strange browser behaviour.
          </p>

          <h2>Other small improvements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              There was a div ending tag that had snuck inside the head tag and copied across all pages. It has nothing to do there, so much so that every browser throws it away and therefore it’s not even visible in devtools, where I did my W3C HTML validation. It is now gone.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What I know remains</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Alternative «all posts» layout, where one can chose a view mode that is more condensed without images, and store your preference in local Storage.
            </li>
            <li>
              A “try again later” message if WP doesn’t answer. (Never had any issues and therefore not prioritizes it)
            </li>
            <li>
              Next and previous article- buttons
            </li>
