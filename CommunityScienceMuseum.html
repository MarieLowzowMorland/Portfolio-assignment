          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            At the end of the autumn semester, I had a semester assignment where
            I was to create a promotion page for a Community Science Museum. Its
            core target audience are primary and middle school children (7-15)
            and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is
            informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school
            pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters
            without pandering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the website, both through user testing and teachers'
            evaluation, has received good feedback on design, considering the
            target group. I therefore concluded that I shouldn’t change the
            design too much, yet I “opened the museum”. By this I mean that I
            removed warning boxes that warned that the museum was closed due to
            covid 19.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of major design changes, I have focused on functionality and
            accessibility. The page was created at a time when I did not know
            JavaScript, and it was coded with pure HTML and CSS. Now that I am
            going to improve the page, it was natural to add some functionality
            to the page through JS.
          </p>

          <h2>Join-event form</h2>
          <p>
            I have two forms on the website: one to sign up for activities, and
            one to donate money to the museum. In this round of improvements, I
            have chosen to create a functional form for the "join event" page.
            The form on the "donate" page is thus something that remains. I
            chose the “sign up” form because that was the one that users had
            tried to use during my user testing and was disappointed when
            nothing happened. I set up a Wordpress instance as a headless CMS
            and installed a plugin called Contact Form 7. This is used to
            receive the forms with registrations for activities and store the
            answers in a database.
          </p>
          <p>
            After receiving good feedback from users on the contact form I made
            in my exam project, I have chosen to create a similar solution on
            this page. With a few small tweaks, I was able to reuse much of the
            code to validate and convey errors in the form. However, I saw that
            the green background color I had on the form was a crash against the
            red error messages and has changed the background color. In general,
            I think that the form “screamed” a bit to the users since there was
            a lot of uppercase labels and warning boxes, the latter gave me the
            impression of an error message before you had even tried to fill in
            the form. As you can see in the pictures below, I have also reduced
            the width of text and input fields, since the width should not
            exceed 80 characters
          </p>

          <h2>Skip links</h2>
          <p>
            While I worked with my exam project, I learned a lot about
            accessibility, and some ways to improve the user experience for
            people that prefer the keyboard. With this fresh in my mind, I added
            skip links to let the user get to the main content with the press of
            just two buttons, avoiding the need to read through a repeating
            menu. Since people who navigate with a mouse does not need these
            links, the link only becomes visible if you use keyboard to focus
            it.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Menu improvements</h2>
          <p>
            Since the page was in pure HTML and CSS, the hamburger menu was
            coded as a hidden ckecbox with the menu button coded as a label.
            This is an obvious breach of WCAG, yet was necessary when I didn’t
            have JS to use for interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, coded it as a button instead was a prioritized task, and
            while I was at it, I also improved the user experience with a tip I
            got during my exam. A user that used VoiceOver on his mobile phone
            told me that it was annoying that he had to navigate back to the
            menu button in order to close the menu after he had just read
            through all the menu options on his way down. Based on his feedback,
            I now added a hidden button at the end, using much the same
            technique as I did with the skip link. Also, I added that the
            original menu button received the focus when the menu was closed so
            that it is easy to open it again, and intuitive to move the focus
            further down the page.
          </p>

                  alt="Exhibition page with menu open, only links in menu list visible"
                />

                />

          <h2>Go-to-top buttons</h2>
          <p>
            The Exhibition page is rather long and had some buttons here and
            there that could move the screen back up again in order to let the
            user easily navigate back up. Using my new routine for testing my
            own page, I quickly discovered that the focus order didn’t work as
            smoothly as intended for keyboard users. Based on my findings, I
            changed the links on the buttons so that it focuses the top of the
            main landmark instead, where there is a list of content with links.
            Now the user can select section from the list, jump to that section,
            tab once to get a link that goes back up to the list of links. I
            felt this was much more useful for a keyboard user.

          <h2>Accsesible images and icons</h2>
          <p>
            When I coded this project, I was quite new to accessibility and my
            primary focus was contrast, responsiveness and that the user should
            be able to i.e, increase the font size. However, when I go back
            using Voiceover I found a lot of missing descriptions of i.e my SVG
            icons. By adding role="img" and aria-label I get the same result in
            assertive technology as an image with alt-text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some places like in the exhibition page, the design changes quite a
            lot between devices (the background image can be on the entire
            section or a div inside). As a result, I had to decide how I would
            make these images available to the audience. While one could argue
            on hand that they are mainly decorative, they are tied to the
            exhibition and I have tried to find engageing images that might
            persuade users to come to the museum. For teenagers as my target
            audience was, it might also feel exculding that your classmates
            discuss or note something about the images that you couldn't see.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first thought I should add the description to the section tag,
            since that was the element that was visible to both mobile and
            desktop devices, even though the latter didn't use it with a
            background image. However, I came to realize that it made much more
            sense for the user to be presented to the image description AFTER
            the heading for that section. I thus added a new div that I marked
            as an image with an accessible name. This means that the image
            description is read aloud for all devices, and after the heading,
            which seems to me like the most user-friendly order.
          </p>
          <p>
            By "All devices" I mean VoiceOver on ios with Safari. VoiceOver with
            Chrome and Safari on OsX, NVDA with Firefox, Chorme and Egde on
            Windows.
          </p>

          <h2>Improved code</h2>
          <p>
            While working with the header, it also became tempting to create
            templates for header, footer, and icons to reuse the html rather
            that duplicate it. This makes the code much easier to maintain and
            improve. One of my feedbacks from the teachers was to use the CSS
            import statement to import the CSS a page needs from the page
            specific CSS-file, rather than having a long list in the HTML file,
            I therefore cleaned up this as well, so that my new HTML-files are
            much shorter now, and more adherent to the DRY principle.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Other small improvements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the document titles, the current page now comes before the
              site. This makes i.e. navigating bookmarks easier.
            </li>
            <li>
              Opened the museum by adding opening times and removing warnings
              that said the opposite
            </li>
            <li>A more prominent focus style.</li>
            <li>
              While it's further explained in Innovation Coach, I found
              horizontal scrollbars due to how Windows browsers calculate
              viewport units. These scrollbars were removed when I decommisioned
              the use of "warning boxes" in the forms.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What I know remains</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Since the museum is now open, I would’ve liked to promote an
              exciting exhibition rather than “The Museum Shop is Open”. I.e.,
              an exhibition about the creation of vaccines.
            </li>
            <li>
              The HTML code would be much more concise if I had templated them
              in JS an extracted the SVGs.
            </li>
            <li>
              After I’ve done other improvements, I now realize that the
              exhibitions should be coded as articles rather than sections,
              since they are independent on each other.
            </li>
