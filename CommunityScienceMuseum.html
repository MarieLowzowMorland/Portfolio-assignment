        <h2>Community Science Museum - A promotion site</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            At the end of the autumn semester, I had a semester assignment where
            I was to create a promotion page for a Community Science Museum. Its
            core target audience are primary and middle school children (7-15)
            and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is
            informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school
            pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters
            without pandering.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the website, both through user testing and teachers'
            evaluation, has received good feedback on design, considering the
            target group. I therefore concluded that I shouldn’t change the
            design too much, yet I “opened the museum”. By this I mean that I
            removed warning boxes that warned that the museum was closed due to
            covid 19.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of major design changes, I have focused on functionality and
            accessibility. The page was created at a time when I did not know
            JavaScript, and it was coded with pure HTML and CSS. Now that I am
            going to improve the page, it was natural to add some functionality
            to the page through JS
          </p>
          <p>This are the changes I have made in this project:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a>Join-event form</a></li>
            <li><a>Skip link</a></li>
            <li><a>Improved the “go to top”-links on the Exhibition page</a></li>
            <li><a>Templated and improved some of the code</a></li>
            <li><a>Other minor things</a></li>
          </ul>
