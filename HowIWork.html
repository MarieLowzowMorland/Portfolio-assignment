          <h3>Getting started – My understanding of the assignment</h3>
          <p>
            After reading the assignment description a couple of times, I set
            out to create a list of improvements that I could come up with for
            all the projects. I set up a checklist in Notes on my mac and
            created a section for each project. Then I reread my earlier
            reports, user feedback, and the feedback I got from teachers to see
            if I had forgotten anything. I prioritized the list and added new
            items whenever I discovered new important improvements and checked
            them off as they got implemented.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, I now have a good list to follow and to help me
            understand when I should jump from one project to the next to be
            able to improve all of them in our given timeframe. Also, it worked
            as a good reminder when writing this report. By sharing it with my
            mobile, I always have the list available, should an idea arise and
            I´m not in front of my computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            After I had finished this initial gathering of task, I started to
            look at the design of the portfolio page so that I would get an
            estimate of how much work it would be to create this
            portfolio/report site. As I was gathering inspiration for a good
            design, I looked at sites like Pinterest and awwards.com, and played
            around in adobe XD. I must admit that I initially misunderstood the
            task somewhat in the beginning and had envisioned a larger page with
            a more classic portfolio made to sell to a potential employer. I
            therefore installed a Wordpress instance for the portfolio together
            with an instance for the Community Science Museum early on to handle
            contact form feedback. However, the scope was clarified on discord
            and I could reduce the size of the portfolio website.

          <h3>Prioritization</h3>
          <p>
            As I observed that my list of improvements continued to grow, I
            realize that my project wouldn’t become perfect, yet I could
            probably fix a few of the most wanted features as well as improve
            some parts of the code and improve accessibility for older projects.
            In addition, the portfolio-site is mandatory, and while one could go
            for a simple design and do it quickly, the assignment said: “The
            portfolio page will form part of your assessment, both from a design
            and technical perspective”. Thus I would rather try something a new
            and challenging, and learn a few new things along the way.
          </p>

          <h3>Accessibility and patterns</h3>
          <p>
            As a front-end developer, I want to create good user experiences,
            and it is important to me that I do not exclude anyone.
            Accessibility is personally something that engages me as I want to
            contribute to an including society. With this motivation in mind,
            simply making my site compliant to Norwegian law is more of a
            minimum requirement, as it is important to me that the user
            experience for someone who is i.e., blind, should not be worse than
            for someone who can see well even if the experiences will be
            different
          </p>
          <p>
            User-oriented design and development for persons with disabilities
            is exciting, and perhaps even more challenging as the user
            experience differs greatly from my own experience. Since I took a
            deep dive into accessibility for the exam, I had a lot of newfound
            experience I could use on the other projects. As an example, the
            user testing I’ve done has given me a lot of insight on how to
            improve some normal web page patterns that I’ve used in the earlier
            sites I’ve made, including skip links and a “Close menu” button at
            the end of an expanded main menu.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h3>This site</h3>
          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p>
            Since the index.html really doesn’t do anything other than
            navigation, I wanted to experiment on how I could make a menu look
            like. I wanted to create a playful and personal design, breaking
            some of the usual patterns for desktop menu and aiming for an
            existing digital experience. I you came to this page on a desktop, I
            hope the hover-effect in the frontpage created a dynamic and mood
            that made you curios enough to swipe around and look under the other
            quadrants as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The colors for each project quadrant and page are fetched form the
            website they represent, and acts like a theme for that project that
            remind you where you are. The polygons are shapes that are repeated
            throughout the site and help the site to gain a sense of identity.
          </p>

          <h4>Coding the index</h4>
          <p>
            Even though the design was easy to draw in Adobe XD, the polygons
            are a bit more challenging to code. I was unsure under which
            landmark to code it at all since I normally use the header tag for
            my main navigational items. After reading through the HTML5
            specification I realized it could probably fit in both the main and
            the header tag, yet since it was the main content for this page, I
            opted for the main landmark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then it was the quadrant itself. I considered everything from
            rotating div tags or make a 2x2 grid where two elements on the
            diagonals were scaled up slightly and then use clip-path in CSS.
            However, I decided to use a huge SVG instead. Partly because it’s
            very nature would avoid responsive or scaling problems with the
            double MMs in the middle, and partly because I wanted to learn more
            about them. I found that one could have links, images and all the
            elements I would require, yet they had new names like “g” instead of
            “div” etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The SVG started from the shell Adobe CD could give me from my
            design, and then I added links, images, and hover effects. I also
            made it possible to scale the font as required with the “em” unit,
            since Safari didn’t support “rem”. Usually I add role=”img” and an
            aria-label to SVGs in order to let screen reads understand Icons. I
            was therefore initially a bit anxious about accessibility when using
            SVG, and I was prepared to have invisible HTML-tags to provide
            screen readers with the information they required. I was therefore
            happy when I used VoiceOver and found out that screen readers read
            SVGs with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            While SVG made the page work, it is always hard to make images with
            motives coexist with text above the image. Especially it’s hard to
            have it work responsively when the SVG preferably should cover the
            entire page, and the user should still be able to scale up the font
            size without zooming into the page. In the end I decided to create a
            portrait version that could be clipped vertically, and a landscape
            version that could get clipped horizontally. I have dragged and
            tested with in a rather large range of possible screen sizes, and in
            the most extreme aspect ratios I add a margin instead of zooming in
            on the SVG, so that the text should always be readable.
          </p>

          <h4>Menu on mobile</h4>
          <p>
            On cell phones, I can’t rely on hover or tab focus and therefore I
            wouldn’t make sense to have the same menu design on smaller screens.
            However, I added a regular hamburger menu, yet used the shape of a
            polygon from the SVG. I could the use the page specific image and
            color to reuse the same menu skeleton yet get a project specific
            feel to the page. Here I’m back in one of the more traditional
            navigation patterns with the menu, and therefore added skip link to
            project pages and the “close menu” button to the menu.
